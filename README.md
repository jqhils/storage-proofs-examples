# Storage Proofs for Historical Ethereum Data

This project demonstrates a variety of interesting use cases for historical storage proofs on Ethereum.

Proof/Verification of each scenario is carried out using both vanilla Solidity and the utilization of the Noir Barretenburg prover system.

Scenarios:
* Generic State Proof
* Generic Storage Proof
* Proving historical ownership of a Crypto PUNK NFT
* Proving activity performed by an Ethereum account between two block heights

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run `npm install`:

```sh
cd ethereum-storage-proofs
npm install
```

Then, define `MAINNET_RPC_URL` in a `.env` file at the root directory.

Finally, run `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Software Libraries & API requirements
* Noir (version 1.0.0-beta.3)
* Hardhat (node version 22)
* Alchemy RPC Endpoint

### Switching proof systems between UltraPLONK and UltraHONK
By default, the project is set to use UltraPLONK for the backend prover, but can be changed to UltraHONK by removing this line in the `hardhat.config.ts` settings file:
```
flavor: "ultra_plonk",
```

## Development

1. Write circuits in `noir` folder.
2. `npx hardhat noir-new <circuit_name>` to create a new Noir circuit.
3. `npm run compile` to compile Noir and Solidity.
4. Integrate with [Solidity verifiers](https://noir-lang.org/docs/how_to/how-to-solidity-verifier) auto-generated by Noir.

## Testing

1. Write tests in `test` folder.
2. `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Deployment

Noir integrates with Solidity, so you can deploy your Solidity contracts like in any other Solidity project using the official [Hardhat Ignition](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started) or community maintained [Hardhat Deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy).
